# FourLaneLapCounter with Motion detection
<p>Lap counter for four lane slot cars, written in python on mobile device. I used camera for motion detection and lap timing, works to within 92-200 milliseconds cycle.
Created to give easy access for four lane lap counting and lap timing by using mobile phone or tablet. 
<i>Motion detection</i> uses the camera to trigger the lap counting and lap timing. 
Could be used for other slot car tracks.</p>
This is my first attempt at python, using pydroid 3 on my mobile phone, i created this for my sons as we couldn't find anything for lap timing.
